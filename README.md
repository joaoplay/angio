## Angiogenesis Project
This project is hosted by the [Centre for Computational Physics](http://condmat.lca.uc.pt/) at the [University of Coimbra](www.uc.pt) 
and consists in a phase-field model for tumor angiogenesis. The model is based on the paper published by
[Travasso et al. (2011)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019989) with some physical and computational improvements.

### Blood Flow (V 5.2.s):
- Blood flow;
- The hypoxic cells now have volume and interact with the endothelial cells;
- The system is modeled in three dimensions;
- We have had implemented a thinning algorithm proposed by [Pal√†gyi and Kuba](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865598000312);
