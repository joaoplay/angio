## Angiogenesis Project
This project is hosted by the [CFisUC](http://cfisuc.fis.uc.pt/) at the [University of Coimbra](www.uc.pt) 
and consists in a phase-field model for tumor angiogenesis. The model is based on the paper published by
[Travasso et al. (2011)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019989) with some physical and computational improvements.

### Version 6.0.s:
- Coupled the blood flow and the hypoxic cell deactivation;
- The hypoxic cells have volume;
- The system is modeled in three dimensions;
- tools: Routines to measure the number of branches, anastomoses and the vessels diameter;
