{"name":"Angio Project","tagline":"Developing a 3D phase-field model for tumor angiogenesis","body":"## About\r\nThis project is hosted by the [Centre for Computational Physics](http://condmat.lca.uc.pt/) at the [University of Coimbra](www.uc.pt) \r\nand consists in a phase-field model for tumor angiogenesis. The model is based on the paper published by\r\n[Travasso et al. (2011)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019989) with some physical and computational improvements.\r\n\r\n### Stable version:\r\n- The hypoxic cells now has volume;\r\n- The system is modeled in three dimensions;\r\n- We have had implemented a thinning algorithm proposed by [Pal√†gyi and Kuba](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865598000312);\r\n\r\n\r\n### Unstable and currently working on:\r\n- Coupling blood flow and the hypoxic cell deactivation;\r\n\r\n### Next features:\r\n- A routine to count the branches and the volume of the vessels;\r\n\r\n![](http://moreirasm.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/git1-e1445266842982.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
